# NetPractice
NetPractice is a 42 project focused on consolidating core networking fundamentals through hands-on simulations. Here, I design topologies, define IP addresses, masks, and routes, and validate traffic flows. This process accelerates understanding of subnetting, gateways, and troubleshooting, strengthening network architecture reasoning in dynamic.
